# User Experience Audit



## Vietnam Airlines

### General Notes
* - Did not detect browser language preference - had to manually switch to EN
* -- Asks on every reloaded page to turn on notifications
* + User actions in primary location, but not the focal point of site
* + Mobile site prioritizes user actions, but is no where near mobile optimized. 

### Making a Booking
* + Recent searches makes returning to trip planning easier on user. 
* ++ Destination dropdown is grouped by region and the field is searchable.
* - Date field does not accept text input - reduces usability on mobile. 
* + Allows flexible dates
* -- Required to agree to T&C before searching for a flight - useless gatekeeping.

### Online Check-In
* ++ Clear directions and multiple options for finding flight
* Required to agree again, this time understandable as "Provision of Restricted Baggage" is included. 


### Conclusion

Overall Score: 2

I would consider the Vietnam Airlines website a baseline for usability. All actions are clearly stated and easy to find with proper instructions and a decent affordances to find what you're looking for. However the site doesn't do much to guide their users to the primary actions. Most of the site is used for marketing and ads - this is a misguided approach considering how few customers are here to "browse." Their mobile site is poorly optimized, but does include the primary user actions at the top of the screen. 




## VietJet Air

### General Notes
* - Did not detect browser language preference - had to manually switch to EN
* --- Primary user actions are sequestered to a small box to make room for distracting promotions and ads
* --- Mobile site prioritizes ad display rather than user actions. 

### Making a Booking
* -- No multiple destination option (Completely ignored use case)
* - Destination dropdowns are organized but in no apparent order - also aren't searchable. 
* + Date field allows text input
* - Currency dropdown selector doesn't work. 


### Online Check-In
* - What looks like a tab on the homepage actually reloads a whole new page. 
* - The whole page for online check-in looks like an error message. 
* - Actions for user not prioritized. 


### Conclusion

Overall Score: -13

Vietjetair.com is a garbage website. This is not my first experience with this atrocity of creation. VietJet's abysmal customer service, gaudy style, and lack of organization as a company are masterfully sewn into their digital presence. VietJet hates their customers, and they try to make it very clear. From disorganized, half working forms, to cancerous eye sores peppered all over the screen, VietJet is using this site to remind us all that Dong is great and you're cattle to be herded. In truth, there is nothing wrong with this website though - because it perfectly reflects the user experience you should expect from VietJet Air. 




## Jetstar Pacific

### General Notes
* + Either website defaults to EN or detected my browser language preference
* -- 80% of homepage space is used for ads and promotions. 
* ++ Mobile site prioritizes user actions

### Making a Booking
* ++ Dropdown for destination selector is well organized and searchable. 
* + Allows option for multi city search
* -- Doesn't allow users to select dates on same page - loads calendar with no text search



### Online Check-In
* + Extremely clear, dedicated page for online check-in. 
* + Available AI for questions on bookings or problems. 


### Conclusion

Overall Score: 4

JetStar Pacific is another example of the website perfectly reflecting the type of experience that you're going to have with the airline. They don't hate you like VietJet does, but they are going to be selling something to you the entire time you spend with them. The site is straight forward with the actions you need to take - this part of the process is optimized. But I fear the optimization is so they won't waste any space assaulting you with deals, ads, and 48k fare (yeah....right....)



## Singapore Airlines

### General Notes
* + Either website defaults to EN or detected my browser language preference
* + Primary user actions located in a modal in the primary position on site. 
* -- Primary user actions not prioritzed on the mobile version of site. Banner and app download are instead featured. 

### Making a Booking
* ++ Auto fills the location you're in airport
* + Options for flexible dates to search for lowest fare
* + Text input for date range

### Online Check-In
* + Easy on-page check-in


### Conclusion

Overall Score: 5

You get what you pay for. The last two airlines are a perfect reflection of that. Limited ads, straight forward and dedicated areas for primary user actions, and ALL major use cases planned for and clearly marked. I've never flown Singapore, it's actually the only airline on the list that I haven't been a customer with - but from their website, I would expect a reasonable experience without too much hassle. (I'd also expect free baggage)



## Emirates

### General Notes
* + Either website defaults to EN or detected my browser language preference
* + Majority of the website opening is dedicated to primary user actions. 
* ++ Mobile site is fully dedicated to primary user actions. 

### Making a Booking
* ++ List of locations is larger than other offerings, so it's difficult to group well. But list is searchable and suggests your "current location airport"
* + Selection of one item immediately opens the next step in the process for making booking on the same page. 
* + Flexible dates for lowest fare and choices
* - Date range not able for text input

### Online Check-In
 * + Easy access check-in process
 * + Includes a "what's on my flight" guide to the plane and service section you have. 


### Conclusion

Overall Score: 9

The Emirates website does a good job reflecting their values as a company. Dedicated and personalized service are clearly reflected in their website when you consider that everything "above the fold" is about the customer, and not about selling or marketing. 



## Overall Conclusion 

User Experience is often talked about in a very etherial way - it's there, or it isn't...who knows how this came to be. But that couldn't be further from the truth. User Experience is a direct translation of how a business treats their customers. The more you understand, the more you listen, and the more you serve, the better the experience your customers will have. That's true for a brick and mortar business, and it's even more true for a SaaS product. All the websites we looked at today have a pretty definitive real life experience when dealing with each provider - you're under their care for extended periods of time and subject to the way they organize and handle the process of air travel. In the end, the website experience is a good indicator of the type of experience you're bound to have when actually taking the flight.
